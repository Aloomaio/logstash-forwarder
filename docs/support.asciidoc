=== Known Issues
==== Network Volumes

We do not recommend to read log files from network volumes. Whenever possible install Filebeat on the host machine and
send the log files directly from there. Especially on Windows reading files from network volumes can have side affects
like changing file identifiers which leads to reading the log file from the scratch again.
