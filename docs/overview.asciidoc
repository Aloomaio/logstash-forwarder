== Overview


Filebeat is a log data shipper initially based on the https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder[Logstash-Forwarder]
source code. Installed as an agent on your servers, Filebeat monitors the log directories or specific log files, tails them and forwards them to
https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[Logstash] for parsing or directly to
https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] for indexing.

Filebeat is a https://www.elastic.co/products/beats[Beat] and it is based on the libbeat framework. 
The general configuration options for libbeat and how to setup Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana can be found
